## üöÄ **Getting Started**

### Prerequisites
Before you get started, make sure you have the following tools installed:
- **Node.js** (v16.x or higher) - [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (v7 or higher) - It comes bundled with Node.js, but you can update it using `npm install -g npm`.
- **JDK 11 or higher** - [Download JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- **Maven** (for Spring Boot) - [Install Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)

### 1. Clone the repository
Clone the repo to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shobhit15082003/Streaming-App-Spring-boot.git
```

### 2. Install frontend dependencies
Navigate to the frontend directory and install all required dependencies:

```bash
cd video-streaming-app/frontend
npm install
```

### 3. Set up and run the backend
Navigate to the backend directory and start the Spring Boot application:

```bash
cd video-streaming-app/backend
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The Spring Boot application will run at `http://localhost:8080`, handling video upload and streaming functionalities.

### 4. Run the frontend development server
Once the backend is up, navigate back to the frontend directory and run the development server:

```bash
cd video-streaming-app/frontend
npm start
```

The app will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Backend Setup (Spring Boot)**

### Backend Responsibilities
The Spring Boot backend is responsible for:
- Handling video uploads (using `MultipartFile`).
- Serving video files using HLS for seamless playback.
- Storing video metadata (title, file path, etc.).

### Video Upload Endpoint
The backend exposes an endpoint to upload videos:

- **POST /api/v1/videos/upload** ‚Äì Upload a video with a title and file.

**Example Request:**
```bash
POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/videos/upload
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

{ "file": <file>, "title": "Sample Video" }
```

After upload, the backend processes the video and returns an ID, which can be used to fetch and stream the video.

### Video Streaming Endpoint
To stream a video, use the following endpoint:

- **GET /api/v1/videos/{videoId}/master.m3u8** ‚Äì Streams the video using HLS based on the provided video ID.

---

## üìº **How to Use**

### 1. Upload Video
- Navigate to the **Upload Video** page in the app.
- Enter a **title** for your video and select a video file.
- Click **Upload** to submit the video to the backend.
- After uploading, the video will be available for streaming.

### 2. Play Video
- Enter the **Video ID** (provided after the upload).
- Click **Play** to begin streaming the video.
- The **HLS.js** player will render and start streaming the video.

---

## üé® **UI Customization**
The app uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling, making it easy to modify the design. You can change the look and feel by adjusting the variables in the `tailwind.config.js` file.

**Key color variables**:
- **Deep Blue**: `#081c3b`
- **Electric Blue**: `#0abde3`
- **Neon Green**: `#00e676`
- **Charcoal**: `#333333`
